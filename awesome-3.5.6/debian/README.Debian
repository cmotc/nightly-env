awesome for Debian
------------------

Do a right-button click with your mouse on a empty screen to start a shell.
Then do 'man awesome' to learn more about the default keybindings and how to change them,
and 'man awesomerc' to edit your configuration file.

awesome uses Mod4 button for modifier by default which is likely to be your Windows key
on i386 or amd64.
