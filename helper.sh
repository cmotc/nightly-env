#	This command should be able to generate a repository for upload.
#	Right now I'm just using apt-git, which is just a little hack I use to
#	host a few debian packages on github pages. apt-git's probably going to
#	become pkg-git when it can also structure other types of repositories.
#	Besides that, it should also be able to do other things, like with aptly
#	and all the other tools for automatically structuring repositories. This
#	needs to be done in part to remove dependencies on github itself.
#	Bitbucket has a similar setup which is cool, but the fewer proprietary
#	dependencies the better and that means self hosting. Which is easy
#	because they're just https servers which means you can shoehorn one into
#	pretty much anything that'll give you the space to do it. Which makes
#	this all a little daunting, because my whole goal is to make this system
#	even more approachable, customizable, and decentralized and all those
#	options leave the definition of those terms open to interpretation.
